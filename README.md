### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer living in Germany and passionate about mixed reality technologies and development. Like every good developer, I have a graveyard of side projects in my garden but I'm doing my best to keep some of them alive, e.g. here on GitHub. In my day-to-day job I create enterprise applications for web, mobile and mixed reality platforms. Got any questions? Let's chat!

(I'll make this README more fun and interesting at some point, I promise...)
